## Features

- **Comprehensive `HTTP` Method Support**: Covers `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, and
  `OPTIONS` methods.
- **File Transfer Functionality**: Supports file upload and download with real-time transfer progress monitoring.
- **Polling Mechanism**: Supports standard polling and long polling with customizable polling intervals.
- **Testing Toolkit**: Capable of stress testing, performance testing, and simulation testing with the ability to
  generate detailed test reports; supports configuration of the number of requests, concurrency levels, and test
  iteration counts.
- **`HTTP` Proxy and Microservice Integration**: Supports `HTTP` proxy and request forwarding, suitable for integration
  development in microservice architectures.
- **Real-Time Communication Capability**: Implements real-time data push via `Server-Sent Events (SSE)` and is
  compatible with `WebSocket` protocol.
- **Request Management and Log Auditing**: Includes built-in request interception mechanisms and `HTTP` request log
  auditing functions.
- **Media Type Handling**: Provides predefined handling mechanisms for mainstream `MediaTypes` and offers an open
  interface for custom handling.
- **Declarative Requests**: Specifying the behavior of requests through simple attribute annotations or interface
  definitions.
- **`MessagePack` Support**: Integrates `MessagePack` serialization and deserialization capabilities to enhance data
  exchange efficiency.
- **Flexible Response Transformation**: Provides common `HTTP` response transformers and supports custom transformation
  logic.
- **High Performance and Resource Management**: Employs memory optimization techniques and connection pool management to
  ensure low resource consumption and high performance.
- **Architecture Design**: Flexible architecture design that is easy to use and extend.
- **Cross-Platform Independence**: Supports cross-platform operation without external dependencies.
- **High-Quality Code Assurance**: Adheres to high-standard coding practices, with unit and integration test coverage as
  high as `98%`.
- **`.NET 8+` Compatibility**: Can be deployed and used in environments running `.NET 8` and higher versions.

## Installation

```powershell
dotnet add package HttpAgent
```

## Getting Started

We have many examples on our [homepage](https://furion.net/docs/http-agent/). Here's your first one to get you started:

1. Register `HttpRemote` service:

```cs
services.AddHttpRemote();
```

2. Retrieve internet data:

```cs
public class YourService(IHttpRemoteService httpRemoteService)
{
    public async Task<string?> GetContent()
    {
        return await httpRemoteService.GetAsStringAsync("https://furion.net/");
    }
}
```
